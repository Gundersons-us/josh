Download Del's 7th album, <em>Funk Man</em>, <a href="http://delthefunkyhomosapien.bandcamp.com/">here</a> for free.

From Wikipedia:

<p style="padding-left: 30px">"On March 31, 2009 Del's new album Funk Man was made available for free download on the internet for one day only. The album will be released in stores on April 7th, 2009."</p>

Better hurry if that's the case! Grab the Leak Packs while you're there too.

There are tons of other artists on that site too, most of whom I didn't recognize.
