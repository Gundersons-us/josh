M<span></span>ozilla released <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox 3</a> today. Of course, I've been running Minefield nightly builds for several months on several machines. I can't even remember what the new features are because they aren't new to me anymore. I'll run the official version 3 for a while before I start running nightly builds again.

<a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/node&amp;id=19865&amp;t=307">Download</a>
<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/press/mozilla-2008-06-17.html">Press Release</a>
<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.0/releasenotes/">Release Notes</a>

The main Addons I use are:

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6543">Nightly Tester Tools</a> (for forcing "incompatible" Addons to install)</li>
    <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865">Adblock Plus</a> + <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4364">Element Hiding Helper</a> (for removing crap I don't want to see)</li>
    <li>Remove It Permanently (for removing stuff that ABP can't)</li>
    <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748">Greasemonkey</a> (for adding features or removing "features" from websites)</li>
    <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843">Firebug</a> (web development tool)</li>
    <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2110">MinimizeToTray</a> (minimizes Firefox to an icon next to the clock instead of as a bar)</li>
    <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4762">Hide Menubar</a> (press Alt to see the Menubar when you need it)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>The release of Firefox 3 kicks off Download Day, the Mozilla communityâ€™s grassroots campaign to set a brand new Guinness World Record for the greatest number of software downloads in 24 hours. The worldwide community effort begins the minute Firefox 3 is released and will continue for a full day.</blockquote>
