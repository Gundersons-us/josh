It's about time. Google has added an image insertion button to Gmail (via Labs). No more attaching or the weird-ass "don't click control-A, but drag-select an image, copy it, and paste it into your message, and hopefully your recipient can see it" work-around.

It's in the Labs for my Google Apps-powered domain e-mail as well. Awesome.
