I upgraded my main PC to the preview today to Build 9431.

It took quite a while to complete. I saw a bluescreen for a split second somewhere during the install.

I have a folder called Windows.old on my C: drive that's ~4.5GB in size.

<strong>Problems</strong>
I couldn't unlock my Bitlock'd eSATA backup drive -- MS's FixIt tool didn't help. I was able to unlock it through Control Panel. My Bitlock'd USB3 flashdrive unlocked like normal, i.e. double-click in My Computer and the box pops up in the top-right corner prompting for password.

<strong>Other things</strong>
I need to enable thin borders again
