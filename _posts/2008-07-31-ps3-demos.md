PS3 demos I've played recently with notes on each.

<strong><a href="https://www.us.playstation.com/PS3/Games/echochrome">echochrome</a></strong>

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
    <li>Escher-esque FTW</li>
    <li>Cool idea. Simple yet good-looking graphics. Not very fun though.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<strong><a href="https://www.us.playstation.com/PS3/Games/Overlord_Raising_Hell">Overlord: Raising Hell</a></strong> $59.99

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
    <li>It reminded me of Fable for some reason.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<strong><a href="https://www.us.playstation.com/PS3/Games/Sid_Meier_s_Civilization_Revolution">Sid Meier's Civilization Revolution</a></strong> $59.99

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
    <li>Probably the simplest of all the Civ games. Also probably the best looking.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<strong><a href="https://www.us.playstation.com/PS3/Games/Nucleus">Nucleus</a></strong>

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
    <li>Didn't care for it.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<strong><a href="https://www.us.playstation.com/PS3/Games/Blast_Factor">Blast Factor</a></strong>

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
    <li>Didn't care for it.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<strong><a href="https://www.us.playstation.com/PS3/Games/Super_Rub_a_Dub">Super Rub a Dub</a></strong>

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>Ducks!</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<strong><a href="https://www.us.playstation.com/PS3/Games/Race_Driver_GRID">Race Driver: GRID</a></strong> $59.99

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>- No 1080</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>+ Feels really fast</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>+ Can have lots of cars on one race (up to 20 as far as I've seen)</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>- No 2-player on the same console/TV</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<strong><a href="https://www.us.playstation.com/PS3/Games/PixelJunk_Monsters">PixelJunk Monsters</a></strong> $9.99

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>+ crisp 1080 graphics</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>It reminds me of flash game(s) I've played, and likewise can be rather addicting at times.</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<strong><a href="https://www.us.playstation.com/PS3/Games/Folklore">Folklore</a></strong> $59.99

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>- No 1080</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>+ Surround sound</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>It reminds me of running around in Final Fantasy X, with the bizarrity of Sanitarium, and has a similar feel to Soul Reaver. It would be better if the characters actually talked (especially during the cutscenes) instead of text boxes. Some areas have a fixed camera, some don't.</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<strong><a href="https://www.us.playstation.com/PS3/Games/Lost_Planet_Extreme_Condition">Lost Planet</a></strong> (online) $39.99

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>- No 1080</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>- First try == "Connection failed."</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>The second game eventually connected and I got to play. The controls are a little different than I've seen, e.g. jam on circle to activate radar towers or eject from a VS that's about to explode, L1 &amp; R1 rotate you 90 degrees. After the game, I received 2348 pts and the other seven players got 0. Then there was a network error and I was disconnected and sent back to the title screen.</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<strong><a href="https://www.us.playstation.com/PS3/Games/FaceBreaker">FaceBreaker</a></strong>

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>+ 1080</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>Pseudo boxing game. Can create your own characters. Was pretty 'meh'.</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<strong><a href="https://www.us.playstation.com/PS3/Games/PixelJunk_Eden">PixelJunk Eden</a></strong>

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>+ 1080</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>Totally bizarre. Reminds me of flOw.</ul>
</ul>
