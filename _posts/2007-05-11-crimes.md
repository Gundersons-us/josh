In case you were unaware, if you are married you can get away with any crime. Even felonies. Here's how:

"You can get away with any crime if you are married."

<ol>
    <li>Commit a crime.</li>
    <li>Have your wife call the cops after taking a picture of you committing the crime.</li>
    <li>Go to jail.</li>
    <li>Get bailed out.</li>
    <li>Let your lawyer drag out the trial for <em>at least</em> 6 months.</li>
    <li>Have someone testify that your marriage was rocky.</li>
    <li>Get acquitted.</li>
    <li>Rinse and repeat.</li>
</ol>

I don't understand how or why, but it <a href="https://www.king5.com/localnews/stories/NW_051107WABbestialitycharge_acquitJM.5b3e0539.html">works</a>.
