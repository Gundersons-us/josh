I've added Google Apps to the site. That means gundersons.us e-mail, docs, calendar, web pages, and start page, all powered by Google.

I'm officially running Vista Ultimate on my main box at home. The only thing that is kind of weird so far is my music is choppy, both in Winamp and in WMP11. I redid my workstation today; now to get Vista on my laptop so all 3 systems I use every day have the same OS. Vista x64 was slow and some stuff wouldn't play nice. The 32-bit seems about the same in terms of speed, but it works. The advice I've received regarding x64 is basically "if you don't need more than 4GB of memory, don't bother." I was running Windows XP Pro x64 on my main system at home. It's very stable, but Photoshop CS3 crashes at random every time I use it. I still need to try it on 32-bit Vista.
