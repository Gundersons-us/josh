New Blu-ray, CD, DVD, and PS3 releases for the month of July that seem interesting to me for one or more reasons.

<h1>July 1</h1>

<h3>Blu-ray</h3>

<ul>
<strong>Gangs of New York</strong>
<strong>Point Break</strong>: Pure Adrenaline Edition
<ul><li>I don't wanna sound like a queer, but I always liked this movie.</li></ul>
</ul>

<h3>CDs</h3>

<ul>
<strong>Deltron 3030</strong> - <em>Deltron 3030</em> (re-issue)
<ul><li>If you don't already own the original, which you should, go buy this. It's a fukken masterpiece.</li></ul>
</ul>

<h3>DVDs</h3>

<ul>
<strong>Lamb of God </strong>- <em>Walk With Me in Hell</em>
<ul><li>Documentary and other live footage.</li>
    <li>07/15: Picked it up at FYE after work tonight. It's fucking badass. I couldn't stop laughing at the Tiger Head part. I need one. I think most of the Disc 2 stuff is on the DVD that came with the Deluxe Edition of Sacrament though. At the end there is a melody and pictures of a woman with LoG then it says "In Loving Memory of Evie Carrano" so I googled the name. From LoG forums:</li></ul>
</ul>

<blockquote>Evie Carrano was a beautiful person. She started with us as a merch girl and became our assistant tour manager and band assistant. Not only did she work for the band, but she was a dear friend to all of us....a sassy sister amongst the dirt bag brothers. She went to the doctor because she had a nagging ache in her shoulder and was diagnosed with Leukemia. It was a total shock to her and everyone around her. She was diagnosed on a Monday and by Tuesday of the following week she was gone. We all loved her and miss her dearly.</blockquote>
