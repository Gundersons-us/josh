Overall</h3>

The levels seem weird, like I'm listening to the radio or a cassette tape. I hope it's just a shitty rip or transcode or something. I like the drum tone on the last two albums better as the snare sounds bizarre at times. It's Lamb of God and it fucking rocks. I can't wait to get the special edition and scream along in the car.

<h3>Track By Track</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>The Passin</strong>g (1:58)
The acoustic intro sounds more like Down song than Lamb of God</li>
    <li><strong>In Your Words</strong> (5:24)
Comes in fierce, sounds like a pre-Ashes Lamb of God song, then the sung vocals remind me of later Type O Negative sung vocals</li>
    <li><strong>Set to Fail</strong> (3:46)
Sung pre-chorus voice reminds me of Damageplan, other than that, sounds like it could have been on <em>Sacrament</em></li>
    <li><strong>Contractor</strong> (3:22)
Reminds me of "An Extra Nail For Your Coffin", the Japanese bonus track on <em>Ashes of the Wake</em></li>
    <li><strong>Fake Messiah</strong> (4:33)
notes</li>
    <li><strong>Grace</strong> (3:54)
A finger-picked intro, almost Spanish guitar style,</li>
    <li><strong>Broken Hands</strong> (3:53)
notes</li>
    <li><strong>Dead Seeds</strong> (3:40)
notes</li>
    <li><strong>Everything to Nothing</strong> (3:50)
notes</li>
    <li><strong>Choke Sermon</strong> (3:20)
notes</li>
    <li><strong>Reclamation</strong> (7:05)
Waves crashing, acoustic (dropped-D?) intro, comes in with a hard groove and a growl, acoustic outro fades to waves crashing.</li>
</ol>

I haven't heard any of the bonus tracks yet. :(
