<h1>April 1, 2008</h1>

<strong>Anti-Flag</strong> - <em>The Bright Lights of America</em>

<ul>
    <li>Not bad, definitely better than their last few albums.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Sevendust</strong> - <em>Chapter VII: Hope and Sorrow</em>

<ul>
    <li>Hope: most of the verses/riffs are heavier than usual; Sorrow: the choruses are so singy/pussy.</li>
</ul>

<strong>The Sword</strong> - Gods of the Earth

<ul>
    <li>Badass; sounds like their first album but with more thrash.</li>
</ul>

<h1>April 8, 2008</h1>

<strong>The Grouch</strong> - <em>Show You the World</em>
<strong>Living Legends</strong> - <em>The Gathering</em> EP

<ul>
    <li>They're both pretty dope. I was beginning to wonder if the Legends were starting to fall off. As EvWu2 says, "<em>Classic</em> is not a classic album."</li>
    <li>If you preorder them from Access Hip Hop (I already have), you get a poster and a Drop Card for download of Legendary Music Vol. 2 EP. The posters will be different, however, I suspect the EP downloads will be the same songs, which is kind of lame.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Nine Inch Nails</strong> - <em>Ghosts I-IV</em>

<ul>
    <li>It was pretty bizarre with a touch of Trent. Might put you to sleep though.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Lmno &amp; Kev Brown</strong> - <em>Selective Hearing</em>

<ul>
    <li>I listened to it. It wasn't bad as far as I can remember.</li>
</ul>

<h1>April 15, 2008</h1>

<strong>Children of Bodom</strong> - <em>Blooddrunk</em>

<ul>
    <li>04/24: I listened to it this evening. It's pretty good.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Opeth</strong> - <em>Still Life</em>

<ul>
    <li>This the third re-release of the 1999 album and contains new album artwork, and two discs including stereo and 5.1 remastered versions of the album and a live video of "Face of Melinda". It's a pretty good album.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Rush</strong> - <em>Snakes &amp; Arrows Live</em>
<strong>Soilent Green</strong> - <em>Inevitable Collapse in the Presence of Conviction</em>

<ul>
    <li>I have yet to check either of them out yet.</li>
</ul>

And, it's fucking tax day. Fuck the IRS. If you're legally married for <em>only</em> the first 10 months of a year, you still have to pay taxes as if you were single all year.

FUCK THE IRS.

<h1>April 22, 2008</h1>

<strong>Atmosphere</strong> - <em>When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint that Shit Gold</em>

<ul>
    <li>Got it today at the gettin place. Listened to it twice. I like it, though not nearly as much as any of their previous offerings.</li>
    <li>04/22: I preordered the deluxe edition from Amazon and it only ended up being $9.99. Nice!</li>
    <li>04/23: I actually checked my mail today and it was in there. The DVD that comes with the deluxe edition is sick. It's just a live show but it's with a band and it's badass. The more I listen to the album the more I like it.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Prodigy</strong> (of Mobb Deep) - <em>H.N.I.C. Pt. 2</em>

<ul>
    <li>Listened to the original <em>H.N.I.C.</em> (Head Nigga In Charge) back when I was still in college. It was pretty good. I'll have to check this one out.</li>
    <li>04/22: Listened to this yesterday. Reminds me of some old Mobb Deep. It's pretty hard.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Lyrics Born</strong> - <em>Everywhere At Once</em>

<ul>
    <li>I haven't checked this on out yet. Some guys at work were praising Lyrics Born so I need to check it out.</li>
    <li>04/29: Lahna bought it on Sunday. What I heard of it was good.</li>
</ul>

<h1>April 29, 2008</h1>

<strong>9th Wonder &amp; Buckshot</strong> - <em>The Formula</em>

<ul>
    <li>The production is amazing and it's pretty good lyrically. I'll have to pick this one up.</li>
</ul>

<strong>The Roots</strong> - <em>Rising Down</em>

<ul>
    <li>I'm not a big fan of the Roots but I checked this one out. It's pretty good. Has some bangin-ass beats on a lot of the tracks. I'll give it a few more listens before I decide if I want to buy it or not.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Testament</strong> - <em>The Formation of Damnation</em>

<ul>
    <li>Their first studio album in 8 years. It's a pretty badass album. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">Need to grab this one.</span> Got it<span style="text-decoration: line-through">
</span></li>
</ul>

<strong>Portishead</strong> - <em>Third</em>

<ul>
    <li>I'm not a big fan of Portishead either, but I have liked some of their stuff I've heard so I checked this one out too. It wasn't bad, it was really weird. Some of it was really good, some was just plain bizarre.</li>
</ul>
