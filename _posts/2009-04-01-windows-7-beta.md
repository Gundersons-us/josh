I recently upgraded my 8710w (my main home system; it stays closed and plugged in, and is hooked via HDMI to my receiver, which goes to a 42" Sharp LCD "monitor") to <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231135">4GB of memory</a> and a <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822145228">320GB  harddrive</a> (ReFills are huge; the 120GB that came with the laptop almost wasn't cutting it anymore) and have been running the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/">Windows 7</a> Ultimate x64 beta for a week or so now. I have yet to find something that doesn't work on it.

Software, etc. I used regularly on Vista Ultimate x86 that still works fine on the Windows 7 x64 beta:

<ul>
    <li><strong>Adobe <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/photoshopextended/">Photoshop CS4 Extended</a></strong> - The x64 version and it loads very fast and I haven't seen anything weird yet. The only thing I've really done with it so far is create the Custom Logo™ for my <em>gundersons.us Mail Powered by Google</em>®. I'll mess with some of my recent RAW files and see if I can break it.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.propellerheads.se/products/reason/">Reason</a> 4</strong> - I use Reason 4 with my <a href="https://www.akaipro.com/mpk49">Akai MPK49</a>. I had a slight hiccup (the MPK would no longer control the software; I unplugged the USB cable and plugged it back in and it worked again) while I was trying to get the MIDI Clock Beat Sync setup but I think it was because I selected the wrong MPK49 option (select one of the two similar ones, not the different one) in the Advanced Control screen.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.trillian.im/">Trillian Astra</a></strong> - I've been on the alpha test since September of '07. It's not the most efficient piece of software, but I like only having to run one IM program (<a href="https://www.pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a> is good too, less of a resource hog, but there were a few features I like about Trillian better). A lot of the time when an IM window opens, or when I open the main window, the software will grab a 100% of a core (would be the whole system if I didn't have two cores) for 10-20 seconds before responding. Each build works better than the last (except the couple times where they broke something with a new build, but they immediately came out with fixes for those rare occasions). It works about the same as it did on Vista, or maybe better because I'm using a newer build by now.</li>
</ul>

Software that (not surprisingly) still works:

<ul>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.1b3/releasenotes/">Firefox 3.1 beta 3</a></strong></li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.rarsoft.com/rar_archiver.htm">WinRAR</a></strong></li>
</ul>

Broken [partially]:

<ul>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.textpad.com/products/textpad/index.html">Textpad</a></strong> - the Textpad link in the right-click context menu gives an error about not being able to find the file specified. I'm not sure if it can't find the Textpad executable or the file I right-clicked on, but I assume it's the former.</li>
</ul>

Software I still need to try:

<ul>
    <li>Various games</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://flstudio.image-line.com/">FL Studio</a> 8</strong></li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/acidpro">ACID Pro</a> 7</strong></li>
</ul>
