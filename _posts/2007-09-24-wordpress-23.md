WordPress 2.3 has been released and I've updated this site. I also modified the header image above a little using Adobe Photoshop CS3, but I'm still not quite happy with it.

The WordPress beta and both versions of Drupal running on this server are gone now.

J&amp;E and I went to Seattle on Saturday for the <a href="https://www.fremontoktoberfest.com/" target="_blank">Fremont Oktoberfest</a>. The weather held up OK. "Charlize Theron is hott."We went to the Beck's beer garden and got some beers, then we realized you had to pay an unreasonable amount to get in to the actual Oktoberfest area and decided to go to a few places in Fremont instead.

I watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138946/" target="_blank">The Yards</a> with E&amp;L on Sunday and it was pretty weird. I don't necessarily think it was a bad movie, but it was pretty slow. Charlize Theron is hott so that helped. Mark Wahlberg wasn't the badass I expected him to be. Joaquin Phoenix played a pretty good suave &amp; crooked guy.
