I've installed the latest version of bbPress (v0.9.0.1 "Brubeck") <a href="http://gundersons.us/bbpress/">here</a>. WordPress integration FTW!

I've deleted all the [all probably spam] Subscribers to this blog. If you were not a Spamscriber, sorry, please fill in the name fields so you have a better chance of survival the next time I see nearly 100 Subscribers in Users, none of which have made a comment. Ever.
