I spun up a VPS on Vultr over the Holiday Closure (where legally permissible). I was previously using Digital Ocean but Vultr has a Seattle datacenter, which is decidedly closer than the Bay Area.

I imported old blog posts to the new Wordpress install, but I'm not really sure how I'm gonna split stuff up on here yet.
