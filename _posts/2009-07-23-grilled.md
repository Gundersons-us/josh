I finally got around to "fixing" the grille on my car.

Supplies used:

<ul>
    <li>3M WetOrDry 600-grit sandpaper</li>
    <li>Krylon satin black spray paint</li>
    <li>3M Scotch blue masking tape</li>
    <li>masking paper</li>
    <li>Acryli-Clean DX330 Wax &amp; Grease remover</li>
</ul>

First I masked off around the parts I wanted to paint (the Nissan emblem was a chore), then I used the wax &amp; grease remover on the area to be painted. I then wet-sanded the whole area, dried it off, used some more of the wax &amp; grease remover, then sprayed a (probably too thick) coat on. After letting it dry for a bit, I wet-sanded the areas that were red (orange-peel like a muhfucka) or chrome (could see lines where I sanded them) again, and sprayed several thin coats, letting them dry between.

Hopefully I can wash her and get some decent "after" pics this weekend.
