Here's the slideshow video Lahna made:
<a href="http://gundersons.us/media/halloween07.wmv">Original 60MB file</a> (right-click on the link and choose "Save as" to save it to your computer)
<a href="http://gundersons.us/media/halloween07-1.wmv">Smaller 30MB file</a> (right-click on the link and choose "Save as" to save it to your computer)

In Minefield (Firefox 3 alpha builds) I had to close the browser, copy <a href="http://gundersons.us/media/np-mswmp.dll">this .dll file</a> to "C:Program FilesMinefieldplugins", and restart the browser. The regular <a href="http://port25.technet.com/pages/windows-media-player-firefox-plugin-download.aspx"> Windows Media Player Firefox Plugin installer</a> from Microsoft (Port 25 is their open source division) doesn't put the .dll file in the right place so I had to do it myself. Actually, I have no idea where it ends up putting the file. I had to extract the installer .exe, then get a program to extract the installer .msi file. Lame, but it works.

EDIT: The <a href="http://port25.technet.com/pages/windows-media-player-firefox-plugin-download.aspx"> Windows Media Player Firefox Plugin installer</a> from Microsoft also won't install correctly if you are using Firefox on Windows Server 2003. Download that same <a href="http://gundersons.us/media/np-mswmp.dll">.dll file</a> to "C:Program FilesMozilla Firefoxplugins" and restart your browser.

EDIT2: The installer stuck the files in "C:PFilesPlugins". I'm all, you gotta be shittin' me.
