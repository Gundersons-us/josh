New Blu-ray, CD, DVD, and PS3 releases for the month of May that seem interesting to me for one or more reasons.

<h1>May 6</h1>

<h3>CDs</h3>

<ul>
<strong>7L &amp; Esoteric</strong> - <em>Esoteric vs. Japan</em>
<ul><li>I really wanna check this one out, but I can't find it at the gettin' place yet...</li>
    <li>05/01: It's dope! Bangin' ass beats with random Japanese clips thrown in for good measure. I'm fucking getting it, that's all there is to it.</li></ul>
<strong>All Natural</strong> - <em>Elements: Fire</em>
<ul><li>05/28: Listening to it now. It's good.</li></ul></ul>

<h1>May 20</h1>

<h3>Blu-ray</h3>

<ul>
<strong>Anger Management</strong>
<strong>Blades of Glory</strong>
<strong>Face/Off</strong>: Special Collector's Edition
<strong>V for Vendetta</strong>
</ul>

<h1>May 27</h1>

<h3>CDs</h3>

<ul>
<strong>Al Green</strong> - <em>Lay It Down</em>
<ul><li>New Al Green album produced by ?uestlove. I'll give it a listen.</li></ul>
<ul><li>05/28: Pretty lame overall. Less than half the songs even have a decent beat/feel ("Just for Me", "You've Got the Love I Need", "What More Do You Want from Me", and "Standing in the Rain" are about it). I'm definitely passing on this one as I'd probably never listen to it again anyway.</li></ul>
<strong>J-Live</strong> - <em>Then What Happened?</em>
<ul><li>I haven't checked it out yet.</li></ul>
<ul><li>05/28: Starts off with a pretty tight, horn infused beat. It's pretty good, but I want to listen to it again before the final verdict.</li></ul>
</ul>
