You can add multiple blogs to it and choose which one you want to publish (or push a draft) to via dropdown.</p> <p>During installation it asks if you want to use a test post to download your theme so you can more accurately preview your posts before you publish, but it failed to download my theme for some reason.</p> <p>I haven’t closed this post yet, and it’s smart enough to update the same post each time I hit publish instead of making a new one, which would be annoying.</p>
