I updated to WordPress 2.3.1 the other day. It fixes over twenty bugs and some security issues in WordPress 2.3 as well as some other things I could care less about.

I updated to phpBB 3.0.RC7 today. It let me type in my FTP details and it updated files for me, which I thought was pretty cool. I have no idea what it fixed and I don't feel like looking.
