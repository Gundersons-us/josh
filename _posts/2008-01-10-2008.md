First post of the year is about a Wordpress upgrade.

I just upgraded to WordPress 2.3.2, "an urgent security release that fixes a bug that can be used to expose your draft posts". Which reminds me, I never finished the review of the Atmosphere show in Bellingham, and I haven't said shit about the handful of other shows I've been to.

Word.
