Barnes &amp; Noble have released the second software update for the nook.

v1.2, boasts

<ul>
    <li>"Enhanced in-store seamless connectivity to enjoy free Wi-Fi, with our More In Store content and promotions exclusively for nook owners.</li>
    <li>Improved opening of eBooks and periodicals</li>
    <li>Improved response to Reading Now &amp; Settings buttons</li>
    <li>Current reading page and bookmarks on all eBooks is properly saved when your nook is powered off</li>
    <li>Bookmarks display page number</li>
    <li>Eligible LendMe™ eBooks in My Library include a LendMe™ flag</li>
    <li>Easier navigation of daily subscription with issues rolled into one folder</li>
    <li>Improved "back" button functionality for navigating eBooks and periodicals</li>
    <li>Personal files downloaded onto nook and displayed in My Documents can be sorted by author &amp; title</li>
    <li>Overall system improvements and battery optimization"</li>
</ul>

You can sideload the file to get the update now or wait until the next week or so to have it automatically download and apply the update Over-The-Air or WiFi.

Approximate time to update:

<ul>
    <li>4-5 minutes via sideload</li>
    <li>5-7 minutes via WiFi</li>
    <li>10-15 minutes via Fast &amp; Free wireless</li>
</ul>

To verify you have the latest update, go to Settings and check to see that your Software version is 1.2.0.

Stuff I've noticed:

<ul>
    <li>Different icons/skin in LCD</li>
    <li>"Sort by" and "Show" actually show the current setting next to them now</li>
    <li>Document loading and page navigation is faster</li>
    <li>highlighting for selected items on eInk screen is different</li>
    <li>fonts slightly different when navigating Library, The Daily, etc.</li>
    <li>screensaver set to Cityscape (still said Authors in Settings but I saw a bridge)</li>
</ul>
