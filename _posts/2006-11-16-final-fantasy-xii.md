"It took me a bit to get used to the battle system."I really like it. It takes me back to Final Fantasy VI days (III on the SNES). It did, however, take me a bit to get used to the battle system. The license board is simple. I don't spend the points until I find the best weapons, etc. available at any given shop and unlock them accordingly. Gambits are nice too. The game looks pretty good, but I wish it was output in HD to take advantage of my new TV.
