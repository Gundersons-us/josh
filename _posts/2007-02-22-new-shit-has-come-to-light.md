We got tickets for a few upcoming concerts: <a href="https://www.lamb-of-god.com/">Lamb of God</a> (with <a href="https://www.trivium.org/">Trivium</a>, <a href="https://www.machinehead1.com/">Machine Head</a>, and <a href="https://www.gojira-music.com/">Gojira</a>) in <a href="https://www.bigeasyconcerts.com/index.cfm?Action=home&amp;VenueID=68">Spokane</a> 3/1, <a href="https://www.thebloodbrothers.com/">The Blood Brothers</a>  (with <a href="https://www.ilovecelebrationmusic.com/">Celebration</a> and <a href="https://www.triumphoflethargyskinnedalivetodeath.com/">Triumph of Lethargy Skinned Alive to Death</a>) in <a href="https://www.showboxonline.com/">Seattle</a> 4/27, Blue Scholars in <a href="https://www.showboxonline.com/">Seattle</a> 5/12. Going to be awesome.

I drove out to Snoqualmie on Saturday and took some <a href="https://joshg253.deviantart.com/gallery/">pictures</a> with my <a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&amp;fcategoryid=139&amp;modelid=14256">new camera</a>. Been sick with stomach shit lately. Upgraded an <a href="https://h20341.www2.hp.com/integrity/cache/342108-0-0-225-121.html">rx8640</a> to <a href="https://www.intel.com/business/itanium/index.htm">Montecito</a> today, went great, other than having to re-solder a loose connection for a processor fan.

Fuck yeah:<br />
