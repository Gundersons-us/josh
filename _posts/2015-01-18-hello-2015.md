Ok, figured it out:

Made a WordPress multisite now, with subdirs under gundersons.us using EE.

Had some issues at first, trying to run EE after I had already gotten a single WordPress blog up &amp; running, so I took a Snapshot (free right now since they are apparently in beta) and blew it away, started fresh using some excellent initial setup tutorials on Vultr &amp; DigitalOcean, ran the EE setup and it went through with no complaints.

I plan on using the gundersons.us domain for any of my music-related projects.
