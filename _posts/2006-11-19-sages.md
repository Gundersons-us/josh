We ate dinner at a restaurant in Redmond called Sages."Fuck El Gaucho, go to Sages for half the price." The food was excellent. I had Salmon Portuguese and she had Filet Mignon of course. I have never had salmon that juicy before. The filet was as large and better than the $50 one I had at El Gaucho a few months back. The service was good too. Fuck El Gaucho, go to Sages for half the price, a less crowded restaurant, and not having to let a stranger drive your car.
