Just went on <a href="http://quiz.ravenblack.net/blood.pl?biter=joshg253">Vampires! The Dark Alleyway</a> and got this message:

<blockquote>Apologies for the downtime - there was an explosion in the server farm, taking down both my servers (as well as thousands of others). They are working on getting everything back up - unfortunately, my secondary server is up while the primary is not. Hopefully it will all be working again in the next 24 hours. All Vampires quests will be extended appropriately, Warlocks will probably just have to deal, and if you were looking for my blog or something, please come back tomorrow.

No data was lost, everything should be back to normal once they have restored power. Nobody was injured by the explosion, though three walls were knocked down.</blockquote>

An actual explosion. Pretty strange.
