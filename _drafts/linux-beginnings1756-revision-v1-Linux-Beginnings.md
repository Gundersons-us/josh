<p> TL;DR: some background on my experiences with Linux, through 2015.</p>

<p>In 1999 or so I bought a boxed The Complete Linux Operating System 6.0 from the Tacoma CompUSA (or was it still Computer City then?). Or maybe I got it at Future Shop in South Hill? Or Borders in Tacoma? Or Borders in South Hill that replaced the Future Shop?! Anyway, it included Linux-Mandrake 6.0, which was purported to be "Red Hat Linux 6.0 with enhancements", stepped you through a super tedious installation, and once you finally got it installed, the GUI looked like crap. But it was an interesting learning experience.</p>

<p>Then around 2003 during college I revisited Linux, trying a few on my Dell Inspiron 5150 laptop and eventually buying a boxed copy of SuSE Professional (9.x series) from the Tacoma CompUSA. </p>

<p>I was amazed at how much easier installation was and how much more  polished everything looked. I seem to remember hating Gnome2 and  preferring KDE3 at the time. We also used Red Hat (also 9, I think) in  class. </p>

<p>I also remember spending countless hours trying to get a PCMCIA SpeedBooster WiFi card to work in Linux on that laptop. Something about using a wrapper on the Windows drivers, building a module, and recompiling the Kernel. Not sure I ever got that card working in Linux.</p>

<p>Immediately after college I was working in a lab at Intel and some of  the testing I did there required various Enterprise Linux distros on the  SUT and/or clients. </p>

Then I hadn't been using Linux at all since working on-site at 
Microsoft, but in 2010 I "needed" to root my Nook (the original gimmicky
 eInk + tiny touchscreen LCD one) and the available tools were for Linux
 only. So I did some research and found Linux Mint, got it installed in 
VirtualBox, setup a shared folder, and was able to root the Nook.

<p>In 2011 I built a new PC and maxed it out with 24GB of memory, specifically so I'd be able to run more VMs. Since then I've always had an up-to-date Mint VM, and have tried dozens, if not hundreds, of versions of various distros in VirtualBox. In 2013 I picked up a&nbsp; 17" Sony VAIO E-series (SVE1712BCXB) laptop and immediately replaced the mismatched 4GB + 2GB DIMMs with a matching pair of faster 4GB DIMMs and swapped out the ultra-crappy 500GB HDD for a decent SSD. Within a couple months, I also set it to Legacy Mode and disabled Secure Boot to get Linux Mint to work. No idea if this would still be necessary today. I think once I get a larger SSD (or a new laptop!) I'll look into UEFI&nbsp; / SecureBoot / GPT again. By the end of 2015 I also had Arch installed on my laptop, using Architect Linux.</p>

<h3>Adventures in Arch(itect)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the past I've tried out Arch (and Gentoo) in VirtualBox and deemed them to be an amazing learning experience but too cumbersome for daily use. I stumbled across Architect Linux in 2015 and it basically provides a step-by-step installation for Arch so you can get up and running and start tweaking. You can select as many or few WMs/DEs as you like, but make sure you also install a network manager. After the Architect install, some other things to install:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>yaourt - French for "yogurt", this wrapper will essentially replace pacman, adding colors and AUR to the results</li><li>libs32 - needed for Steam</li><li>infinality font patches - makes for a really smooth experience</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So my current thought with Arch is that (if you use Architect) it's not a pain to get installed, and once it's up tweak to your heart's content. The package management allows you to install updates similar to APT but simpler:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">pacman -Syu</pre>
<!-- /wp:preformatted -->

<p>or</p>
